# Start using Azure AD Privileged Identity Management

With Azure Active Directory (AD) Privileged Identity Management, you can manage, control, and monitor access within your organization. This scope includes access to resources including: Azure resources, Azure AD and other Microsoft online services like Office 365 or Microsoft Intune.

This article tells you how to add the Azure AD PIM app to your Azure portal dashboard.

## Add the Privileged Identity Management application

Before you use Azure AD Privileged Identity Management, you need to add the application to your Azure portal dashboard.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as a global administrator of your directory.
2. If your organization has more than one directory, select your username in the upper right-hand corner of the Azure portal. Select the directory where you want to use PIM.
3. Select **More services** and use the Filter textbox to search for **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management**.
4. Check **Pin to dashboard** and then click **Create**. The Privileged Identity Management application opens.

If you're the first person to use Azure AD Privileged Identity Management in your directory, you are automatically assigned the **Security administrator** and **Privileged role administrator** roles in the directory. Only privileged role administrators can manage Azure AD directory role assignments of users. In addition, you may choose to run the [security wizard.](active-directory-privileged-identity-management-security-wizard.md) that walks you through the initial discovery and assignment experience.

## Navigate to your tasks

Once Azure AD Privileged Identity Management is set up, you see the navigation blade whenever you open the application. Use this blade to accomplish your identity management tasks.

- **My Roles** displays a list of eligible and active roles assigned to you. This is where you can activate any assigned eligible roles.
- **Approve Requests (Preview)** displays a list of requests to activate eligible Azure AD directory roles by users in your directory, which you are designated to approve. [Learn more.](./privileged-identity-management/azure-ad-pim-approval-workflow.md)
- **Pending Requests (Preview)** displays any of your pending requests to activate eligible role assignments.
- **Review Access** lists active access reviews you are assigned to complete, whether you're reviewing access for yourself or someone else.
- **Azure AD directory roles** located under the manage section of the left navigation menu displays the dashboard for privileged role administrators to manage role assignments, change role activation settings, start access reviews, and more. This dashboard is disabled for anyone who isn't a privileged role administrator. These users have access to a special dashboard titled My view. The My view dashboard only displays information about the user accessing the dashboard, not the entire tenant.
- **Azure Resource roles (Preview)** located under the manage section of the left navigation menu displays a list of subscription resources you have role assignments choose
